While FOSS foundations differ greatly in their operations and approach, the majority of organizations keep the technical governance separate from the governance of the organization.

Open source communities strive for technical excellence.  FOSS foundations are there to support this effort, but the organization and the project are typically distinct entities, each focused on what they do best.

The \href{https://openinfra.dev/}{Open Infrastructure Foundation} supports the development and adoption of open infrastructure globally by hosting open source projects and communities of practice.

Thierry Carrez, VP of Engineering at the Open Infrastructure Foundation, explains:

\begin{quote}

We do not require any organization to pay in order to successfully join our communities.  Technical governance of our projects is disconnected from Foundation governance: one individual may be a leader in our projects without their employer being a Foundation member.  This ensures the project is open to everyone, including individuals, maximizing participation and adoption.
