As part of deciding whether it's better to create a new organization or work with an existing one, the project needs to perform some self-reflection and think about diverse topics, including the project's vision, roadmap, culture, requirements, and more.

There are a number of specific topics that need consideration when evaluating whether to start a new organization versus joining an existing one:

\begin{itemize}

\item Needs: what needs does the project have now and how will those change in the future as the project moves through different phases?  What services do different umbrella organizations offer?

\item Culture: what are the values of the project?  Are there existing organizations that have similar values and is there a cultural fit?

\item Sustainability: does the project have the resources to run its own organization?  What have other organizations done to ensure their sustainability?

\item Level of integration: is there a preference to have a loose relationship with another organization, integrate closely with an existing organization, or maintain full control by operating a new organization?

\end{itemize}

These high-level questions may guide the decision-making.
