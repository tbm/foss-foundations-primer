The \href{https://flossfoundations.org/}{FLOSS Foundations} community is a useful resource to learn about FOSS foundations.  It maintains a \href{https://flossfoundations.org/foundation-directory/}{foundation directory}, which is a great place to find organizations to examine.  There's also a mailing list where people involved in FOSS foundations share their knowledge and experiences.

The \href{http://chooseafoundation.com/}{Choose A Foundation} website offers some guidance on choosing a foundation, but it currently only lists a small number of FOSS umbrella organizations.

The TODO Group offers a number of \href{https://todogroup.org/guides/}{open source guides}.  Similarly, GitHub maintains some \href{https://opensource.guide/}{open source guides}.

\href{https://fossgovernance.org/}{FOSS Governance Collection} provides an indexed collection of governance documents from open source projects.
