\begin{itemize}

\item Joining

\begin{itemize}

\item What fees are there?

\item What is the process to join?

\item Does joining offer alignment with other projects?

\end{itemize}

\item Intellectual property

\end{itemize}

\item How loose or close is the relationship?

\end{itemize}

\item Governance

\begin{itemize}

\item Is the organization stable?

\item Does the organization have enough resources to support the project?

\item How transparent is the organization?  Are governance structures documented?

\end{itemize}

\item Services

\begin{itemize}

\item Does the service menu match the needs of the projects?

\end{itemize}

\item Leaving
