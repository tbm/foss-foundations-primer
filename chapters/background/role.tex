FOSS foundations play an important role in supporting open source projects and contributing to their long-term sustainability.  The people involved in FOSS foundations have considerable experience and often have encountered similar problems to those a project faces.  They know from experience what works and what doesn't.  Some organizations also provide specific mechanisms to help young projects, for example through mentorship or a formal incubation process for new projects.

A foundation can also serve as an independent entity that represents the consensus of a project.  The process of creating a new organization, or selecting an existing organization to join, is a useful exercise because it forces a project to think about a number of issues, such as governance, asset management, culture, vision, and more.

There's a wide range of different FOSS foundations (as will be covered in more detail later).  They support open source projects in a number of key areas, including governance, community, financial, and legal.

While there are a number of different types of organizations, the emphasis in this primer is on umbrella organizations.  These are organizations that provide a nourishing environment and offer a set of services to multiple projects that operate under their umbrella.
