\chapter{The role of foundations}
\labch{role}

While open-source projects come in all shapes and forms, most projects encounter a similar set of growth issues throughout their life cycles.

This primer covers non-technical aspects that the majority of projects will have to consider at some point.  It also explains how FOSS foundations can help projects.

While there are a number of different types of organizations, the emphasis in this primer is on umbrella organizations.  These are organizations which provide a nourishing environment and offer a set of services to projects that operate under their umbrella.

FOSS foundations play an important role in supporting open-source projects and contributing to their long-term sustainability.  The people involved in FOSS foundations have considerable experience and often have encountered similar problems to those a project faces.  They know from experience what works and what doesn't.  Some organizations also provide specific mechanisms to help young projects, for example through mentorship or a formal incubation process for new projects.

A foundation can also serve as an independent entity that represents the consensus of a project.  The process of creating a new organization or selecting an existing organization to join is a useful exercise because it forces a project to think about a number of issues, such as governance, asset management, culture, vision, and more.

There's a wide range of different FOSS foundations (as will be covered in more detail later).  Cánovas Izquierdo and Cabot identified \href{https://doi.org/10.1145/3183428.3183438}{eight categories} into which the main activities of foundations can be grouped:

\begin{itemize}

\item Open-source promotion

\item Event organization

\item Project sponsorship

\item Training

\item Legal support

\item Government involvement

\item Standard leadership

\item Community coordination

\end{itemize}
