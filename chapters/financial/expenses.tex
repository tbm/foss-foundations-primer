There are a number of ways money can be used to improve a project, including:

\begin{itemize}

\item Domain names
\item Infrastructure
\item Hardware for contributors
\item Artwork
\item Documentation
\item Development
\item Internships
\item Training
\item Travel stipends
\item Conferences
\item Hackathons and other development meetings
\item Marketing materials
\item Operations (including accounting and legal)

\end{itemize}

Some services, such as continuous integration (CI) infrastructure and pro-bono legal help, may be available to open-source projects free of charge.  In some cases, it might make sense to use project resources to pay for a service anyway (for example to get a faster response or more reliable service).

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=PSF Grants Program]

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) operates a \href{https://www.python.org/psf/grants/}{grants program} which allows members of the community to apply for funding.  The current focus is on virtual events, virtual sprints, and Python diversity and inclusivity efforts.

Events and projects that receive funding from the PSF are required to submit a report showing how grants were used.
