\chapter*{Preface}

Starting an open-source project is easy.  Running a successful project, on the other hand, comes with a lot of work and responsibilities, especially if the project attracts a large user base.

While open-source projects come in all shapes and forms, most projects encounter a similar set of growth issues throughout their life cycles.  Because of this, various organizations have arisen to help projects handle these problems; these are the \textit{FOSS foundations} described here.

This primer covers non-technical aspects that the majority of projects will have to consider at some point.  It also explains how FOSS foundations, non-profit organizations that support open-source projects, can help projects succeed and grow.

This primer explains:

\begin{itemize}

\item What issues and areas to consider

\item How other projects and foundations have approached these topics

\item What FOSS foundations bring to the table

\item How to choose a FOSS foundation

\end{itemize}
