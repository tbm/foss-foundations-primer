Several projects and organizations offer formalized mentorship programs to make it easier for those new to open source to get involved.  Some organizations also pay stipends to mentees.

The Linux Foundation offer a \href{https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/about/diversity-inclusivity/mentorship/}{mentorship program} to help developers ``to learn, experiment, and contribute effectively to open source communities''.  Projects that mentees can work on include the Linux kernel, Hyperledger, and GraphQL.  The organization also provides \href{https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/tools/mentorship}{tooling} through which projects can run mentorship programs.

X.Org's \href{https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgEVoC/}{Endless Vacation of Code (EVoC)} is another program that pairs those interested in working on a project with a mentor.

Several organizations offer mentorship programs that are open to many open source projects, including \href{https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/}{Google Summer of Code} and \href{https://www.outreachy.org/}{Outreachy}.  Being part of an organization may allow a project to participate in such outreach programs.

\begin{kaobox}[frametitle=Outreachy: increasing diversity in open source]

\href{https://www.outreachy.org/}{Outreachy} intends to increase diversity in open source by offering remote internships to ``anyone who faces under-representation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the technology industry of their country'':

\begin{quote}

Interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, illustration, graphical design,  data science, project marketing, user advocacy, or community event planning.

Mentorship and outreach programs are a good way for projects to attract new contributors and grow their community.  Foundations can help by taking care of the legal paperwork and distributing funds.
