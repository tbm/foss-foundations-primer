\chapter{Governance}
\labch{governance}

The majority of FOSS foundations have a board of directors that governs the organization.  The role of the board is to define the vision of the organization and to provide oversight.

Dirk Riehle and Sebastian Berschneider \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33442-9_2}{identified} three ways in which board membership is determined:

\begin{itemize}

\item Democratic: directors are elected by members of the organization.

\item Meritocratic: status is earned through continued project work.

\item Autocratic: the board selects new directors.

\end{itemize}

Some organizations have members that can participate in elections and other decision-making processes.

Organizations with staff are usually led by an Executive Director (ED), a role similar to the CEO of a company.  The Executive Director works closely with the board to define the vision, implements that vision, manages staff, and oversees the daily operations.

It's important to remember that the governance of the project and that of the organization are distinct, even though there can be a great overlap between the philosophy, approach, and the people who are involved.

Directors (members of the board of directors) have a fiduciary duty toward the organization.  A fiduciary duty describes a relationship between two parties that requires one to act solely in the interest of the other.  Directors have to act in the interest of the organization.

There are typically three legal duties:

\begin{itemize}

\item Duty of care: directors must show a certain level of competence and diligence, for example by attending meetings and staying up-to-date with the organization's finances and activities.

\item Duty of loyalty: directors must act in the best interest of the organization.

\item Duty of obedience: directors must ensure the organization follows and adheres to its mission, governance policies, and any laws or regulations.

\end{itemize}

The Charities Bureau of New York State published \href{https://www.charitiesnys.com/pdfs/Right-From-the-Start.pdf}{a document} outlining the responsibilities of directors.
