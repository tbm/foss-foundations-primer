FOSS organizations aim to meet the needs of the projects they serve.  Umbrella organizations typically offer a range of services, broadly reflecting the project needs described in this primer (such as mentorship, asset stewardship, and event management).  Different projects use different services based on their needs.  Typically, projects can choose \textit{à la carte} from a menu of services.  Umbrella organizations usually take a percentage of project donations in order to provide their services.

Of course, not every organization offers everything.  For example, several organizations don't employ staff to write software.  This can be for a number of different reasons, including:

\begin{itemize}

\item Philosophical reasons: an organization may wish to provide infrastructure for a project but stay out of development.
\item Lack of demand: the ecosystem has enough companies that pay for development, so there's simply no need to employ developers.
\item Organizational limitations: some organizations are not prepared for the paperwork involved with having employees.

\end{itemize}
