Javier Luis Cánovas Izquierdo and Jordi Cabot \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10063.pdf}{classify} FOSS organizations according to three orthogonal dimensions:

\begin{itemize}

\itemsep 0.50em

\item Geographical scope: local or global focus

\item Coverage: focus on a specific project or domain, or a broader focus, possibly serving as an umbrella organization

\item Transparency: the degree of transparency in governance (e.g. by-laws) and operations

\end{itemize}

In terms of geographical scope, there is a wide range of focus.  The PostgreSQL community has several organizations, like PostgreSQL Europe and PostgreSQL.US, that serve a specific geography, typically to organize events in those regions.  Organizations like FOSSASIA and the Free Software Foundation Europe have a fairly specific (albeit still fairly broad) geographical scope.  Other organizations, like the Eclipse Foundation, serve a truly global community.

The coverage can also vary greatly.  There are several organizations that provide a specific service or focus on a particular problem, such as the Software Freedom Law Center, which offers legal services to open source projects, and Linux Professional Institute (LPI), which promotes the use of open source by developing certification standards.

Several organizations focus on a specific project, such as the Krita Foundation and the Blender Foundation.  Some organizations, like KDE e.V. and the Python Software Foundation, were originally created to serve a specific project; as those communities grew and expanded, so did the role of the organizations.

Finally, there are umbrella organizations that accept a wide range of projects.  Some of these have a focus on a specific theme, such as scientific computing (NumFOCUS), biological research (Open Bioinformatics Foundation), and cloud computing (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).  Other umbrella organizations serve projects from a wide range of backgrounds.
