Open-source projects typically operate globally, but the organizations that serve them have to establish a legal entity in some jurisdiction.  One question is whether the country of that entity matters.  While projects are used to operating via the Internet, setting up a legal entity often involves activities that have to be done in person (such as opening a bank account).  Therefore, some FOSS foundations are established where they are simply because that's where a volunteer willing to do the work was located.

The location of the legal entity may matter in some circumstances.  If the majority of donors are in a specific region, it makes sense to establish the legal entity there in order to make donations easier.  For example, bank transfers are easy within the EU, but many US-based organizations don't have bank accounts there.  The tax deductibility of donations across borders is also a big question.  Similarly, if the majority of members in a trade association are from one region, it's probably best to form an entity there.

Finally, some grants may be restricted to organizations in certain regions.  For example, the European Commission has a number of funding initiatives and some are limited to organizations based in the EU.

Apart from these factors, the jurisdiction doesn't seem to matter that much.  The specific rules for non-profit organizations are different in each jurisdiction, but every place has regulations that the organization has to follow and comply with.

The Eclipse Foundation serves a global community.  While the organization has an office in Canada and employees in Germany, it was incorporated as a trade association in the US state of Delaware.

In 2021, the Eclipse Foundation \href{https://newsroom.eclipse.org/news/announcements/open-source-software-leader-eclipse-foundation-officially-transitions-eu-based}{moved its corporate home to Europe} by establishing an international non-profit association in Belgium:

The Eclipse Foundation already has more than 170 members and over 900 committers based in Europe. The formalization of the Eclipse Foundation AISBL non-profit association will enable it to leverage its EU presence and recent international growth to foster global industry collaboration on open source projects in strategic technologies, such as the cloud, edge computing, artificial intelligence, connected vehicles, telecommunications, and the Internet of Things.
