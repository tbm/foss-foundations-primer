Unfortunately, sometimes things don't go as planned.  A conference may have to be canceled because of a pandemic, or a project may be involved in a lawsuit (for alleged trademark or patent infringement, or other reasons).

While such issues will always be painful and time-consuming to deal with, having an organization is beneficial in such cases.  The organization will be better equipped to deal with such issues than individuals on their own.  A legal entity may also offer certain protection for individuals.  For example, individual contributors wouldn't be liable for a venue contract signed by a FOSS foundation.

Project and organizations can also plan ahead by putting strong governance in place.  When drafting policies and decision-making documents, take into account scenarios where things go wrong.

A FOSS foundation should also take out directors and officers (D\&O) liability insurance to safeguard directors who serve the organization.  Other insurance policies, such as for conferences, are also a good idea.
