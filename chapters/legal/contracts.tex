Some projects have to deal with a surprising amount of paperwork.

Contracts have to be signed for a number of reasons, and can include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Sponsorship agreements

\item Grants

\item Venue rental

\item Employment contracts

\item Intellectual property rights and provenance

\item License enforcement agency

\end{itemize}

It usually doesn't make sense for individuals to sign contracts on behalf of a project.  It's much better for this to be done through an organization that represents the project.
